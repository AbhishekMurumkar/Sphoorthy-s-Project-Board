<p>The quotes on this book's cover from eminent figures do indeed
reflect its contribution as a compendium (488 pages) of facts,
figures and analysis on the production and use of scholarly
journals. King and Tenopir have been working in the field of
scientific knowledge dissemination for many years (King's earliest
listed reference going back to 1971), and bring a carefully weighed
perspective on both paper and digital technologies for research
dissemination. The subtitle, "Realities for Scientists, Librarians
and Publishers" reflects their concern to represent the interests
of all the key stakeholders in the situation in which we now find
ourselves. Moreover, their understanding of these concerns helps to
explain the inertia of an industry which has evolved over 300 years
from the first journals in order to satisfy the varied agendas that
are in play today. They emphasise throughout that innovations in
the process or product of scientific publishing will have to
clearly prove their worth to be sustained in the long term. This
may seem like stating the obvious, but amidst the charged,
frictionless rhetoric of the internet and e-business, this is a
welcome reality check.</p>
As someone relatively new to the publishing industry (ejournals are
but one of many implications of the knowledge and collaboration
technologies that are my research field), the book was extremely
useful as an introduction to the field's players, scale and
dynamics, as well as a treasure trove of references, especially to
early efforts to develop network-based alternatives to paper
dissemination. The NSF and British Library initiatives of the
1960s-80s are not cited much, giving the impression that preprint
archives and ejournals are a Web phenomenon. This is, however,
anything but a book concerned only with ejournal technology. The
title "Towards Electronic Journals" reflects its historical
perspective, providing us with what is probably the best factual
foundation for understanding paper journals today, as well as the
potential impact of new technologies. A glance at the list of
Tables gives a flavour of what is to come, e.g. "Average importance
ratings of factors used by authors for selecting journals, 1976,
1979", "Break-even point in readings between personally subscribing
to journals and using the library at various journal pricings and
distance to library", Total journal costs by academic and special
libraries, projected to 1998", Start-up ongoing costs for an
electronic journal".<br />
<br />
<p>The book's extended <a href=
"http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/psyc-bin/newpsy?11.084" target=
"xref">precis</a> in <i>Psycoloquy</i> (itself an interesting
example of internet-mediated scholarly communication) gives a
useful overview for prospective readers. The rest of this review
will therefore overlay a particular lens, namely, that of an
ejournal co-founder and editor (of what I discovered is a "Level 6"
ejournal in terms of its functionality; p.327). Specifically, I
wanted (1) to better characterise my own ejournal's niche in the
broader scheme of scholarly publishing, and (2) find expert
assessment of the claims often made about the economic and
dissemination improvements that networked dissemination (not
limited to just ejournals) can make.</p>
<p>The 'executive summary' provided in Chapter 1 lists the authors'
key conclusions on the potential impact of ejournals, details of
which are then unpacked in later chapters. A key conclusion seems
to be that ejournals <i>could</i> reduce costs: "Perhaps the
greatest challenge and best opportunity for electronic journals
involves future pricing. It is clear that past strategies have not
been successful and that new, truly innovative approaches will be
required." (p.44). This is qualified with emphasis on factors such
as journal circulation, publisher size, and whether publication is
dual media (paper and electronic) or electronic only.</p>
<p>The authors present an excellent critique of the commonly
encountered argument that the average article in a paper journal is
hardly read (hence we need new dissemination routes, and even to
disband the whole concept of the journal). The whole of Chapter 7
is devoted to the qualitative and quantitative readership of
journals (drawing attention to different patterns by academic and
industry scientific communities), and making the case that (in
general) journals are both regularly read and beneficial (there are
even figures suggesting that the most successful scientists read
more journal articles than the average).</p>
<p>Specifically on electronic publishing, Chapters 15-18 present a
valuable collection of data, although Chapter 16 (Economic aspects
of the internet) is, inevitably, already dated, and better served
by a related website (the number of ISPs is estimated from a 1996
report; the value of the network services market is estimated from
a 1995 report).</p>
<p>A lot of the authors' work has examined costs at every stage in
the dissemination process, and publishers and librarians should
find it a valuable reference point. Occasionally, I was a little
bemused by some of the analyses, such as the following cost
exercise: "The second element of cost [to readers] involves the
time of readers [&hellip;] We estimate scientists' time at $0.805
per minute and other such expenses as equipment and facilities at
$0.06 per minute. Printing is estimated to cost $0.53 per article
($0.045 X 11.7 pages). Thus, the reader cost per reading for
obtaining an electronic article online from a subscription is
approximately$7.00 per reading, versus $5.10 for reading paper
versions [&hellip;] Therefore it costs less for the electronic
version up to 10.5 readings (or more), while it costs more
electronically above that amount, although the difference is not
enough to be of great concern." (p.377).</p>
<p>I have to confess to wondering how useful such quantifications
will be, based as they are on a particular set of assumptions.
Often, the data for the assumptions often comes from questionnaires
to researchers about their practices, but there was no critical
discussion, e.g. in discussing reading habits, of whether
scientists might not be serving several agendas (only one of which
is to give the researcher the truth) when reporting how much they
read of what. I was, on occasion therefore, left feeling
unconvinced. Obviously, a book cannot do everything, and the
authors' meticulous attention to costing the full lifecycle of
documents served to highlight for me a limit to this book's
contribution, where future research must take up the baton.
<i>Quantitatively,</i> the book scores highly on describing the
terrain over which journals have travelled, but there is little
which will help ejournal publishers design their journals, the
terrain we have yet to cross. <i>Qualitatively,</i> we seem to know
relatively little about how scientists search for articles, read
them, annotate them, share them, or review them -- the stuff of
everyday life -- and how they wish things might be in the future.
How could ejournals and other network resources better support
these activities? The book contributes high level descriptions of
new functionality that ejournals could offer, based on a few
examples, but there are no evaluation reports of such ejournals in
terms of user interaction or satisfaction. The main reason is
likely to be that such data simply does not yet exist, and this
limitation is a function of the book's timing in this transitional
phase of publishing history. Given the correct importance that the
authors place on genuine, value-added innovation in dissemination
media, this research vacuum stands out all the more. We need to
know not only what and how much scientists do something, but
<i>how</i> they accomplish this work individually and collectively
in their day to day lives. Without such naturalistic,
design-oriented knowledge, software developers cannot be blamed for
thinking they know what researchers do, only to perpetuate the
pattern of providing tools that are never really integrated into
everyday working life.</p>
<p>A second non-trivial limit to the book's coverage concerns the
peer review process. Whilst the book makes evident that journals
serve multiple functions, to the most important stakeholders --
namely the researchers -- the quality control function is what
distinguishes journals from the vanity press and anything else that
can be placed on the internet. In the whole book, we find three and
a half pages dedicated to peer review (pp. 136-139), summarising
some research on the amount of time scientists spend as referees,
and a couple of proposals for peer review ratings over networks.
There are occasional appearances of the topic elsewhere (e.g.
citing studies that confirm the value that researchers place on
peer review). There is, however, a substantial research literature
into the effectiveness of the anonymous peer review system which
does not receive any mention. This is surprising since elsewhere
the authors note that the journal system is often criticised for
its delays in publishing (due in part to stalled peer review
processes), but the key point is that journals as a concept are
most clearly distinguished by the freely donated refereeing of
researchers. If there is a second edition to the book, then a
detailed discussion of the pros and cons of new, electronically
mediated peer review models would be a prime candidate for
inclusion. For instance, radical proposals that envisage the
replacement of journals with a networked repository of unrefereed
literature with voluntary ratings are technically implementable,
but fail to engage many of the human dimensions: When we're all too
busy, why would anyone bother to rate something? What does a number
represent, and do individuals use ratings comparably? How to
prevent abuse of the system? Do studies critical of the fairness of
current review processes support the idea of simple digital
replication, or (as we have done in <a href=
"http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/" target="xref">JIME</a>) is this an
opportunity to promote such 'radical' ideas as the author's right
of reply during review?</p>
<p>Finally, the book comes to a rather abrupt end after a
discussion of alternative pricing models. Perhaps the authors were
content to let the chapters' overviews and summaries stand without
further elaboration, but some concluding comments would have been
welcomed (or is the relentless desire for closure merely a
vestigial legacy of the codex before we learn to write open
hypertexts?!).</p>
<p>In summary, for anyone interested in scholarly publishing,
electronic or paper, the authors are to be congratulated on
coherently organising and discussing a vast amount of data from
their own and others' work. This provides a sobre, balanced
foundation on which to build the next generation socio-technical
infrastructures we require to access timely, quality research
information.</p>
